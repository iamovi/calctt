# Calctt

Calctt is a command-line calculator tool built with Node.js. It supports basic arithmetic operations, mathematical functions, and more complex calculations.

## Features

- Perform basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, %, ^).
- Evaluate mathematical functions such as square root, sine, cosine, tangent, logarithm, exponential, absolute value, rounding, floor, ceiling, factorial, greatest common divisor (GCD), and least common multiple (LCM).
- Read expressions from command-line arguments or interactively from the user.

## Usage

### Installation

You can install Calctt globally using npm:
