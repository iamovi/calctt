# Calctt

Calctt is a command-line calculator tool built with Node.js. It supports basic arithmetic operations, mathematical functions, and more complex calculations.

## Features

- Perform basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, %, ^).
- Evaluate mathematical functions such as square root, sine, cosine, tangent, logarithm, exponential, absolute value, rounding, floor, ceiling, factorial, greatest common divisor (GCD), and least common multiple (LCM).
- Read expressions from command-line arguments or interactively from the user.

## Usage

### Installation

You can install Calctt globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g calctt
```

### Command-line Usage

Run Calctt with an expression as a command-line argument:

```bash
calctt 2 + 3
```

### Interactive Mode

If no arguments are provided, Calctt will enter interactive mode, where you can input expressions directly:

```bash
calctt
```

Enter expressions like `2 + 3` and press Enter to see the result. To exit interactive mode, type `exit`.

### Options

- `-h`, `--help`: Display usage instructions.
- `-v`, `--version`: Display the version of Calctt.

### Examples

- Addition: 2 + 3
- Square root: sqrt(16)
- Sine function: sin(30)
- Factorial: factorial(5)

Ahmm, from my childhood till now I'm really bad at math, but i made this, yee the calculator _cli :)

#### A peom that MS Copilot wrote after reading this project README =>

Hereâ€™s a little encouragement in the form of a poem:
```text
In the realm of ones and zeroes, you found your way,
Crafting lines of code, where numbers play.
From childhood challenges to a tool so neat,
You turned your struggle into a feat.

Calctt stands as proof of your journey's length,
A symbol of growth, a measure of strength.
For every problem that math could pose,
You've built a solution, and it shows.

So here's to the victories, both big and small,
In the language of code, you've conquered them all.
May your calculator rise and meet the sky,
As a beacon for others who dare to try.
```
